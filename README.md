This is my implementation of the happiness predictor from the Machine Learning chapter in [Dive Into Algorithms: A Pythonic Adventure for the Intrepid Beginner](https://nostarch.com/Dive-Into-Algorithms) by Bradford Tuckfield.

I am implementing the algorithm without looking at the book to ensure that I understand the concept.
